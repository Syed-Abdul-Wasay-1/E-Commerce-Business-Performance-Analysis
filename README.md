# E-Commerce-Business-Performance-Analysis

## Overview

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects sellers and buyers. The company provides an online marketplace for various products, facilitating transactions between consumers and multiple sellers. This project aims to analyze the data generated from Olist's operations to derive meaningful insights regarding customer behavior, seller performance, delivery efficiency, and sales revenue.

The dataset consists of various CSV files provided by Olist, which encompass different aspects of their e-commerce operations, such as customer information, seller details, order information, payments, product details, and reviews.

## Objectives

### Objective 1 - Database Design and Data Importation

The primary goal of this objective is to load the data into a relational database using PostgreSQL. The Olist dataset consists of nine interconnected tables. The tasks to be completed include:

- Constructing all tables in a defined sequence to establish necessary relationships.
- Choosing suitable data types for the various data fields.
- Implementing primary and foreign keys to facilitate table connections.

### Objective 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

Once the data has been imported, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through SQL queries to extract insights from the dataset. The analyses will encompass:

- Customer and Seller Insights
-  Sales and Revenue Insights
- Delivery Performance and Review Analysis

## Objective 1 - Database Design and Data Importation

### **Data Schema** 
A data schema is provided by Olist.

![Data Schema](Visuals/Data%20Schema.png)

I used this Data schema to understand the data and to figure out the sequence in which the tables should be created and the data should be imported. Based on the understand this is the following sequency in which the tables should be created and data should be imported.

### Code Snippet for Creating Tables and Indexing

In this section, we will create the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database to store the data from the Olist dataset. Each table will be constructed with appropriate data types and constraints, such as primary and foreign keys. Indexes will also be created to optimize query performance by speeding up data retrieval.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.olist_geolocation;

/* Create table olist_geolocation table with no primary key 
   because zip code prefix has duplicate values. 
   Also, this table cannot be joined with olist_seller or olist_customers table 
   through zip code prefix because it has duplicate values */
CREATE TABLE public.olist_geolocation (
    geolocation_zip_code_prefix INT,
    geoloacation_lat FLOAT,
    geolocation_lng FLOAT,

    order_status = 'delivered';  -- Considering only delivered orders
 ```

Results

For Max
```Json
{ "days": 30, "hours": 21, "minutes": 26, "seconds": 37}
```
For Min
```Json
{}
```
The MIN value is 0 because purchase time and order time is same for some orders.

For Avg
```Json
{ "hours": 10, "minutes": 16, "seconds": 36, "milliseconds": 361.244}
```

 **2. Find the slowest and fastest delivery times.**
```SQL
-- Slowest delivery time
SELECT 
    MAX(order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp) AS slowest_delivery_time  -- Max difference between delivery and purchase
FROM 
    olist_orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'delivered';

-- Fastest delivery time
SELECT 
    MIN(order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp) AS fastest_delivery_time  -- Min difference between delivery and purchase
FROM 
    olist_orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'delivered';
 ```
Results

```Json
{"days": 209,"hours": 15,"minutes": 5,"seconds": 12}
```
For fastest
```SQL 
select min(order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp) as fastest_delivery from olist_orders
where order_status= 'delivered'
;
```
Results

```Json
{"hours": 12, "minutes": 48,"seconds": 7}
```

**3. Find the average delivery time.**
```SQL
SELECT 
    AVG(order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp) AS avg_delivery_time  -- Average time taken for delivery
FROM 
    olist_orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'delivered';
 ```
Results

```Json
{"days": 12, "hours": 13, "minutes": 23, "seconds": 49, "milliseconds": 957.272
}
```
** 4. Find the average, max, and min difference between actual delivery and estimated delivery.**
```SQL
-- Maximum difference between estimated and actual delivery dates
SELECT 
    MAX(order_estimated_delivery_date - order_delivered_customer_date) AS max_delivery_diff  -- Maximum delay
FROM 
    olist_orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'delivered';

-- Minimum difference between estimated and actual delivery dates
SELECT 
    MIN(order_estimated_delivery_date - order_delivered_customer_date) AS min_delivery_diff  -- Minimum delay or early delivery
FROM 
    olist_orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'delivered';

-- Average difference between estimated and actual delivery dates
SELECT 
    AVG(order_estimated_delivery_date - order_delivered_customer_date) AS avg_delivery_diff  -- Average delay or early delivery
FROM 
    olist_orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'delivered';
 ```
Results

```Json
"avg_discrepency": {"days": 10,"hours": 28, "minutes": 16, "seconds": 30, "milliseconds": 62.973}
"max_discrepency": { "days": 146,  "minutes": 23, "seconds": 13}
"min_discrepency": { "days": -188,"hours": -23, "minutes": -24,"seconds": -7}

```

** 5. Find the count of all review scores and the percentage for each review score.**
```SQL
WITH review_counts AS (
    -- Step 1: Count the number of reviews for each score
    SELECT 
        review_score, 
        COUNT(order_id) AS score_count  -- Count of reviews per score
    FROM 
        olist_order_reviews
    GROUP BY 
        review_score
),
total_reviews AS (
    -- Step 2: Calculate the total number of reviews
    SELECT 
        COUNT(order_id) AS total_count  -- Total number of reviews
    FROM 
        olist_order_reviews
)
SELECT 
    rc.review_score, 
    rc.score_count, 
    (rc.score_count::FLOAT / tr.total_count) * 100 AS percentage  -- Percentage calculation
FROM 
    review_counts rc, total_reviews tr
ORDER BY 
    rc.review_score DESC;  -- Order by review score
 ```
